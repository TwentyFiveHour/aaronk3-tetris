
This is a classy Tetris program themed on the Lovecraft mythos, 
created by Aaron Kaufman. (The program, not the mythos.)

The main function is in TetrisGUI.java.

HOW TO PLAY:
This game plays just like ordinary Tetris.  Except!  
You can choose to play as a Great Old One, who gets a 
specific power that it can execute every so often.  
The amount of time it takes to regenerate this power
 increases based on how often you use it, however, 
 so be careful!  Note also the difficulty modifier 
 to the lower left.  On the more powerful characters, 
 this makes the blocks fall significantly faster from
  the get-go.

SWITCHING CHARACTERS:
 Use the Great Old Ones menu to select a new character, 
 then start a new game!

CONTROLS:  
See right hand of the screen.
